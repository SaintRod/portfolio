# About

During my tenure at Consumers Energy, my sibling team was responsible for generating customer contact lists for Marketing teams.
Mostly these lists were created via simple random sampling.
However, there were some astute stakeholders that wanted to test if stratified sampling would yield more accurate results.
Initially, the team accomplished this manually, but it was error-prone and onerous.
So, I built a Shiny app for them to automate the task.
Below is a replica of that work.
