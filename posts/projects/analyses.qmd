# Internet outage detection using Julia

Years ago I had a faulty internet router.
The problem was I didn't know it was the router yet.
Eventually I set up a shell script to ping the router and log results.
I analyzed the results and discovered that the router was the issue.
I replaced the router with a Gryphon router - if you haven't heard of it, I highly recommend it.
Additionally, this was my first foray into the work of programming with Julia.
