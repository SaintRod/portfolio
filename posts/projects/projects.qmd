This is the largest section, and the one hiring manager and recruiters will most likely be interested in.

In this section you'll find code, output, and more!
My interests span a wide range of topics, from building web apps to machine learning models.

The following are areas I'd like to explore further, presented in no particular order.

- RAG
- deep learning
- auto diff
- optimization
- Genie in Julia
- Shiny for Python
- build an API
- causal ML
