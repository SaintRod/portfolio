This is the largest section, and the one hiring manager and recruiters will most likely be interested in.

In this section you'll find code, output, and more!
My interests span a wide range of topics, from building web apps to machine learning models.

The following are areas I'd like to explore further or projects I want to work on, presented in no particular order.

- RAG (LLMs)
- deep learning from scratch (Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- auto diff (Jax, JuMP)
- optimization
- Genie (Julia)
- Shiny for Python
- build an API (fastAPI, plumber)
- causal inference (unsure **yet** how this differs from experimentation from a statistics perspective)
- survival analysis
- a primer on driver analysis
- highlighting the utility of categorical data analysis
