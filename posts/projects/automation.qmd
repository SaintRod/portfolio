# Language agnostic project template

I present a handy shell script to automate and standardize data analysis project structures. Yes, several language-specific templates exist, but using them assumes the language for the project has already been chosen. Often when planning a project, I don't select a language until later in the planning stage. Also, much of a project's structure is language-agnostic so there's no need to wait to lay the foundation.
