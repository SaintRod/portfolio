# About

In August my spouse and I welcomed a tiny human into our lives.
Life was good.
And then while I was on parental leave when I was informed that my team at Deloitte, about 20 people, would be let go.

This dashboard was created to track my job search post Deloitte.
However, anyone can use the dashboard as the code is open-source.
The repo README provides instructions on how to do this.
