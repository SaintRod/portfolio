# About

I find it helpful to make my notes available online so that I can access them from anywhere.
The following notes are from lessons on data structures and algorithms.

- [data structures](https://saintrod.github.io/data-strucs-and-algos/posts/data-structures/post.html)
- [algorithms](https://saintrod.github.io/data-strucs-and-algos/posts/algorithms/post.html)

The course provided Python examples, and I replicated these examples using Julia and R.

- [Julia](https://github.com/SaintRod/data-strucs-and-algos/tree/main/code/julia)
- [Python](https://github.com/SaintRod/data-strucs-and-algos/tree/main/code/py)
- [R](https://github.com/SaintRod/data-strucs-and-algos/tree/main/code/r)
