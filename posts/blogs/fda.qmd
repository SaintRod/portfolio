# About

Since first learning about splines c.2020 I have been fascinated with functional data analysis (FDA).

Over the years I've explored applications of FDA at work and for personal projects.
I created this blog to collect these works and house them under one roof.
The blog also provides me an avenue to share thoughts about the work that might not fit into the work itself, such as how the document was created, why I used certain software, etc.

The blog can be accessed [here](https://saintrod.github.io/fda-blog/).
